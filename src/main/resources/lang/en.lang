help.uncrafter.title=----- ----- ----- Uncrafter Guide ----- ----- -----
help.uncrafter.description=The Uncrafter is the exact opposite of the workbench, it splits crafted items back into their crafting ingredients. To uncraft an item, open the Uncrafter and drag the item or stack you want to uncraft into the upper row.
help.matter.title=----- ----- ----- Materializer Guide ----- ----- -----
help.matter.description=Convert items into energy and into other items. That's basically it. In the left upper corner your stored energy is shown. Drop an item into one of the 7 slots at the top in the middle to convert it into energy and to unlock the item. In rows 2 - 6 your unlocked items are shown. Left-click to pick one, right-click to pick a full stack. Now, since the space is limited, maybe not all your unlocked items are shown. In the right upper corner you can place a "lock". Then only items with the same or lower matter value are shown. There may also be "god items" which will unlock all items when dropped into the materializer.
help.link.title=----- ----- ----- Linking Guide ----- ----- -----
help.link.description=You can "link" a furnace or brewing stand with a chest. This means that whenever the furnace runs out of fuel or anything to smelt or the brewing stand runs out of ingredients, they will look into the specified chest and try to get things out of there that they can use. They will also put their smelting and brewing results in that chest if their "output stack" has reached the maximum stack size. Once you linked a furnace or brewing stand with a chest, you will always be able to link that furnace or brewing stand with an other chest for free. Also, for every unlink you do you'll be able to link a furnace or brewing stand for free. The number of "free links" is shown on the stats page.
help.link.note=Note: You can NOT convert a furnace link into a brewing stand link or the other way round!
